1. Download ANTLRWorks 2 :
http://tunnelvisionlabs.com/products/demo/antlrworks

2. Use the editor to browse and edit the .g4 files

3. If you want to enable all the navigation features of the editor, as Antlrworks does not like imported grammar fragments,
   you can temporarily replace the following directive at the beginning of CobolDirectives.g4 or Cobol.g4 : 
   "import CobolCommon;" by the full text contained in CobolCommon.g4.
